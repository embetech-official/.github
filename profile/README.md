Welcome to the official Embetech GitHub page!

Here you will find demo projects for our embeNET Wireless Mesh Network as well as other useful software components :muscle:

# embeNET demo projects

embeNET is a 6TiSCH-based wireless mesh communication stack providing reliable IPv6 networking for industrial and professional Internet of Things applications. We've built this stack to enable robust and cost-effective way to connect thousands of devices efficiently in a scalable and standards-based modern network. :star_struck: You can read more about the stack on [the official embeNET web page](https://embe.net) :eyes:

embeNET is a cross-platform software. :boom: It can run on a variety of microcontrollers and radio modules.\
Below :point_down: you will find a set of demo projects showing how to use the embeNET network on a number of supported evaluation platforms.

So far the following platforms are supported by demo projects:
- [STM32WL5 on a NUCLEO-WL55JC board](https://github.com/embetech-official/embenet-demo-nucleo-wl55jc)
- [nRF52832 on a nRF52-DK board](https://github.com/embetech-official/embenet-demo-nrf52dk)
- [CC1312R on a LAUNCHXL board](https://github.com/embetech-official/embenet-demo-launchxl-cc1312r1)
- [RC-CC1312R-868 module](https://github.com/embetech-official/embenet-demo-rc-cc1312r-868)

Note that these projects can be easily adapted to other, similar platforms :wink:

# Open-source utilities

Check out other MIT-licensed components. We use them in our projects and now you can too :wink:
- [logger - lightweight logging library in C](https://github.com/embetech-official/logger)
- [embeutils - small set of utilities useful in embedded C projects](https://github.com/embetech-official/embeutils)
